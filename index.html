        Hi! my name is Myke Melo!
        I want to learn how to do basic program at first and work my way up!


        <div>
            <p>I want to be a professional soccer player
                and make my parents proud like every other person!
                I like hanging with my friends at night and watch the stars
                at night while just starring and talking. 
                I went to England for college my first year at The University of Chester and played D1 and Semi-pro 
            </p>
