        <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>

        <div>
            <p>“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle sharply. “You have told me so.”</p>

            <p>“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been learning something of young Hyde.”</p>
            
            <p>The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,” said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”</p>
            
            <p>“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.</p>
            
            <p>“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange--a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”</p>
            
            <p>“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.”</p>
            
            <p>“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”</p>
            
            <p>Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.</p>
